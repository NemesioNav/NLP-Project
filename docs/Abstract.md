### Project Overview

Our project focuses on **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using a **Large Language Model (LLM)**. The goal is to extract named entities from text and evaluate the model’s performance by comparing its predictions with the gold standard annotations.

### Task and Dataset

- **Task:** Named Entity Recognition (NER), which involves identifying and classifying named entities in text.
- **Dataset:** We will use the **TASTEset** dataset [(Link)](https://github.com/taisti/TASTEset/tree/main/data)
  , which contains annotated text samples for entity recognition.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** The model’s performance will be assessed using **precision, recall, and F1-score** to measure its accuracy in entity extraction.

We are open to suggestions and feedback to improve our task.
